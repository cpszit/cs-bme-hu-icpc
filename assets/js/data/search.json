We solve LeetCode-style exercises on platforms such as Codeforces, SPOJ, etc, in a ‘mob programming’ format, mostly using C++ and Python.We welcome anyone who is interested in competitive programming!We run two levels:  VProg Introductory: Recommended for those, who have some basic knowledge in algorithms, such as sorting, binary search, graph travelsals, shortest path, etc and basic programming skills.  VProg Advanced: Recommended for those, who have done competitive programming in the past (e.g. Nemes Tihamér, OKTV Programming, CEOI, IOI, Codeforces).Language is English by default, unless only Hungarians are present.Coordinates  VProg Advanced: Mondays 12:15 - 15:00 and Wednesdays 14:15 - 17:00          Starting on 19 February, 2024      Live @ BME, in room IB134.
