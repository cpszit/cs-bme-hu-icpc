    "content": "The VProg competitive programming study groups are continued this semester, organized by BME VIK SZIT!The study groups’ aim is to work together on improving our competitive programming skills and expanding our knowledge on data structures and algorithms. We solve LeetCode-style exercises on platforms such as Codeforces, SPOJ, etc, in a ‘mob programming’ format, mostly using C++ and Python.We welcome anyone who is interested in competitive programming!We run two levels:  VProg Introductory: Recommended for those, who have some basic knowledge in algorithms, such as sorting, binary search, graph travelsals, shortest path, etc and basic programming skills.  VProg Advanced: Recommended for those, who have done competitive programming in the past (e.g. Nemes Tihamér, OKTV Programming, CEOI, IOI, Codeforces).Language is English by default, unless only Hungarians are present.Coordinates  VProg Advanced: Mondays 12:15 - 15:00 and Wednesdays 14:15 - 17:00          Starting on 19 February, 2024      Live @ BME, in room IB134.        VProg Introductory: Fridays 16:00 - 18:00          Starting on 23 February, 2024      Online, on Discord.
