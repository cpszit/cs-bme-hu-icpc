The VProg competitive programming study groups are continued this semester, organized by [BME VIK SZIT](https://cs.bme.hu/english)!

The study groups' aim is to work together on improving our competitive programming skills and expanding our knowledge on data structures and algorithms. We solve LeetCode-style exercises on platforms such as Codeforces, SPOJ, etc, in a ['mob programming'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming) format, mostly using C++ and Python.

We welcome anyone who is interested in competitive programming!

We run two levels:

- **VProg Introductory**: Recommended for those, who have some basic knowledge in algorithms, such as sorting, binary search, graph travelsals, shortest path, etc and basic programming skills.
- **VProg Advanced**: Recommended for those, who have done competitive programming in the past (e.g. Nemes Tihamér, OKTV Programming, CEOI, IOI, Codeforces).

Language is English by default, unless only Hungarians are present.

## Coordinates
