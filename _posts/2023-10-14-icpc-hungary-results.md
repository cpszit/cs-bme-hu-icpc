As the first round of ICPC is over, we applaud our university's teams for their performance!

During the contest, the teams had to solve 12 challenging algorithmical problems in either C++, Python or Java. All three of our teams have been working hard on improving their programming and problem solving skills in the past year to prepare for this contest and we are proud of their results. :)
