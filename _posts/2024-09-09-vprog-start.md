The VProg competitive programming study groups are continued this semester, organized by [BME VIK SZIT](https://cs.bme.hu/english)!

**Join us on Discord**: [https://vprog.hu/discord](https://vprog.hu/discord)

## VProg Intro

Aimed at 2nd year software engineers at BME, who are just starting out with competitive programming.

This semester, we decided to turn VProg Intro into a video series, coming out weekly on Fridays.

More details in the first video - uploaded a bit earlier - check it out here: [https://youtu.be/j_AS8H_99uw](https://youtu.be/j_AS8H_99uw)

## VProg Advanced

**Tuesdays 18:00, room IB134**

If you have former experience in competitive programming (aka Nemes Tihamér, OKTV Programming II, IOI, CEOI, ICPC, Codeforces, etc), join us in the advanced sessions.
