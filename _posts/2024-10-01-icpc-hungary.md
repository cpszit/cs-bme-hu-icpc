The [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global) (ICPC, formerly known as ACM ICPC)
is one of the oldest, largest, and most prestigious competitive programming contests for college students
in the world. The first round, ICPC Hungary is held every year at ELTE University.

In this contest, teams of three compete against the other teams and the time. Problems must be solved and submitted
in either C++, Java, or Python. It is beneficial for the teams to have at least one member who is familiar with
basic graph algorithms and data structures, and someone who has good programming skills. You can check out the
exercises from last year [here](https://cpszit.github.io/competitions/2023-10-14-icpc-hungary.pdf). If you're
interested and/or you don't have a team yet, join our competitive programming student club,
VProg on [Discord](https://vprog.hu/discord)!

The two best teams from BME participating in the competition will have the opportunity to represent our
university in the regional round, which will be held later this year in Wrocław.
