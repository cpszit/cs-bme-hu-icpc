This Wednesday on VProg Advanced, we'll host a special session by PÃ©ter Szeredi, a prominent figure in
declarative programming and Prolog in Hungary, a professor from my department, BME VIK SZIT. Prolog,
short for "Programming in Logic," emerged in the 1970s for tasks like natural language processing and
automated theorem proving. It remains a popular logic programming language even today.

Prolog is an example of Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI), a symbolic and rule-based system. In contrast to
currently popular approaches, such as machine learning and neural networks like ChatGPT, which struggle
with reasoning, Prolog excels at this task. Future AI technologies may combine these approaches into a
hybrid system, called a "neuro-symbolic AI", with Prolog's reasoning power with ChatGPT's natural
language capabilities.
