As the Central Europe Regional Contest of the ICPC concludes, we congratulate our teams LSZ and DSU for their results!

In December 2023, our university competed against teams from eight countries across Europe. Team LSZ with Levente Gegő, Soma Szatmári and Zoltán Szatmáry secured the 42nd place regionally, while DSU comprising Azam Rakhmatillaev, Benedek Brandschott and Klevis Imeri ranked 57th.

During the contest, the students were tasked with solving [12 challenging exercises](https://cpszit.github.io/competitions/2023-12-10-icpc-cerc.pdf), requiring a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms and the ability to apply these creatively under pressure. The teams had to collaborate effectively, distributing tasks and combining their problem-solving skills to tackle the problems presented.

The competition took place in Slovenia, hosted by the Faculty of Computer and Information Science at the University of Ljubljana. We're grateful to them for organizing the competition and our sponsor, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics from our university for funding the travel of our team members and coach to Slovenia for the event.
